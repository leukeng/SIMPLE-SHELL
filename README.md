0x16. C - Simple Shell
This is a simple shell collaboration project that is being written in C language.
This shell behaves like the bash shell.
It prints a prompt and waits for the user to input a command and does not have memory leak.
It will have a home directory of the current user and the default directory argument for the cd command.
